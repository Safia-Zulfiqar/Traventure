# 🌍 Traventure

**Traventure** is a web-based travel destination guide that showcases some of the most breathtaking locations around the world. It aims to inspire travelers by presenting famous global landmarks with rich visuals and brief highlights.

This project was created as a part of my web development learning journey. It helps me practice structuring a website, working with HTML/CSS/JS, and deploying a live site using GitHub Pages.
